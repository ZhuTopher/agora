Agora is a community-focused chat service; built for Android mobile devices. The intention of the app was to provide people with a way to connect with their local community.

Agora uses the user's mobile phone's GPS location to determine the neighbourhood or city district they're currently in. With that information, they may enter a chat group specific to that small area. Having logged-on via Facebook, they're identified by their first name and thumbnail. Users can then chat and communicate with one another -- making it easy to plan neighbourhood events and stay involved in your local community. <br>
